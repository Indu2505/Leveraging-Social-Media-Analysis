# Leveraging-Social-Media-Analysis
Project Overview: 
This study looks at how AI and machine learning may be used to analyse social media data and improve sales results. Through the examination of consumer sentiment, interaction, and trends in real-time from social media platforms, the initiative seeks to create prediction models that will enhance sales tactics.

Research Question: 

How can firms increase sales performance through social media monitoring utilising AI and machine learning?
Project Implementation:
This project involves data collection from social media platforms, followed by data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure that the data is ready for analysis. Then, various machine learning algorithms (like decision trees, clustering, and regression models) are applied to the data to derive insights. These models will be trained to recognize patterns in user behavior, sentiment, and interactions. Once trained, the models can be used to make predictions about future sales trends, customer preferences, or the effectiveness of specific marketing strategies.
The result is a tool that can assist businesses in:
•	Targeting the right customers with personalized marketing.
•	Identifying key trends early on.
•	Improving decision-making with real-time insights and predictive analysis.

of Machine Learning Models Used:
1.	Clustering Models (Unsupervised Learning):
	K-Means: For customer segmentation or grouping similar data points.
	Hierarchical Clustering: For discovering hierarchical relationships.
	
2.	Decision Trees (Supervised Learning):

	Classification Trees (CART): For decision-making processes that require interpretability.
	Regression Trees: For predicting continuous values based on input features

3.	Deep Learning Models (Supervised Learning):
	Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs): For capturing complex patterns in data.
	Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): For image or text analysis.
	Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): For sequential data or time series forecasting.
